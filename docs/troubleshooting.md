# Troubleshooting

## General Approach

For an overview of the general architecture of the Pulumi Kubernetes Operator, see
["Whatâ€™s New in Pulumi Kubernetes Operator 2.0?"](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pulumi-kubernetes-operator-2-0/#whats-new-in-pulumi-kubernetes-operator-20).

Here's some tips for troubleshooting issues with stack deployments.

### Watch the Kubernetes events

Use `kubectl` to watch for Kubernetes events in a given namespace:

```bash
kubectl get events -n default --watch
```

Key events to watch for:

- `StackUpdateDetected` - the controller intends to perform a Pulumi stack update (`pulumi up`).
- `ConnectionFailure` - the operator is unable to connect to the workspace pod.
- `InstallationFailure` - the `pulumi install` command is failing within the workspace pod.
- `Initialized` - a workspace pod was successfully initialized with your program source code and is ready to perform stack updates.
- `UpdateSucceeded` - a stack update succeeeded.
- `UpdateFailed` - a stack update failed.
- `StackCreated` - the stack is now up-to-date

### Check the Status information

The Stack object has a rich status field with information about the latest update activity and about conditions
affecting the stack deployment. Use `kubectl describe stack $STACK_NAME` to see the status block.

Look for:
- `.status.lastUpdate` - key information about the last stack update that was applied.
- `.status.currentUpdate` - information about a planned or ongoing stack update.
- `.status.conditions` - conditions affecting the stack, including important messages.

### Monitor the workspace pod logs

The workspace pod is where Pulumi deployment activity happens. Use `kubectl logs` (or [stern](https://github.com/stern/stern))
to see log output from the Pulumi CLI.

### Force a Update

When a stack fails to deploy for any reason, the system applies a back-off retry strategy. After a few tries,
the system waits for an hour or longer before trying again.

It is possible to force the operator to make another attempt, simply by annotating your stack object as shown below. 

```bash
kubectl annotate stack $STACK_NAME "pulumi.com/reconciliation-request=$(date)" --overwrite  
```

### Get a Shell to a Workspace Pod

By default, the operator leaves the workspace pod in-place after running a stack update. Feel free to use the workspace
pod for interactive troubleshooting and to use the Pulumi CLI. For example, to get a shell to the workspace pod for
a Stack named `random-yaml`, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl exec -i -t random-yaml-git-workspace-0 --container pulumi -- bash
```

The default directory is the location of your program source code.  You should be able to run Pulumi CLI commands from there.

### Enable Pulumi Verbose Logging

The Stack API provides a convenient option for increasing Pulumi's log verbosity:

```diff
apiVersion: pulumi.com/v1
kind: Stack
spec:
+  pulumiLogLevel: 10
```

## Specific Issues

### Fetching from Flux Source

The `fetch` init container is responsible for fetching your program source code. When using a Flux source,
the pod connects to the `source-controller` pod in the `flux-system` namespace.

If your cluster has [Network Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) enabled,
a policy must be configured to allow the above traffic. Apply this manifest: [operator/config/flux/network_policy.yaml](./operator/config/flux/network_policy.yaml).

### Stack Conflicts

On rare occasion, your Pulumi stack may become locked in the state backend. To unlock your stack:
1. Get a shell to your workspace pod (see above).
2. Run `pulumi cancel`.
